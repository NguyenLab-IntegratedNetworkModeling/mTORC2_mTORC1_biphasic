# mTORC2_mTORC1_biphasic
Dynamic modelling of the PI3K/mTOR signalling network uncovers biphasic dependence of mTORC1 activity on the mTORC2 subunit Sin1

Signalling networks are the key information-processing machineries that underpin the ability of living cells to respond proportionately to extra- (and intra-) cellular cues. The PI3K/mTOR signalling network is one of the most important signalling networks in human cells that regulates cellular response to hormones such as insulin, yet our understanding of the network behaviour remains far from complete. Here, we employed a highly integrative approach that combines predictive mathematical modelling, biological experimentation, and data analysis to gain novel systems-level insights into PI3K/mTOR signalling. We constructed new mathematical models of this complex network incorporating important regulatory mechanisms. In contrary to commonly held views that mTORC2 lies upstream and is a positive regulator of mTORC1, we found that their relationship is highly nonlinear and dose dependent. This finding has major implications for mTORC2-directed anti-cancer strategies as depending on the cellular contexts, blocking mTORC2 may reduce or even enhance mTORC1 activation, the latter could inadvertently blunt the effect of mTORC2 blockade. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that mLST8 is required for the assembly and activity of both mTOR complexes, and suggest mLST8 is a viable therapeutic target, notably breast cancer.
